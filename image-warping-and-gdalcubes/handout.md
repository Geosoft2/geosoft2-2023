# Image Warping and Gdalcubes
When someone is working with collections and time series of satellite imagery it is possible to get problems very fast.
 Some of these problems are :
  1. Images from different areas of the world may have different spatial reference systems
  2. The pixel size of a single image sometimes differs among its spectral bands.
  3. Spatially adjacent image tiles often overlap.
  4. Time series of images are often irregular when the area of interest covers spatial areas larger than the extent of a           single image.
  5. Images from different data products or different satellites are distributed in diverse data formats and structures.

## What is image warping ?

## what is gdalwarp and what does it do ?

## How is gdalwarp used in gdalcubes ?
